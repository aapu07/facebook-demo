            <p>“We can rarely tell others what we really think about them--not just because it would so wound them, but
                also because it would so wound ourselves.”
                ― Douglas Kennedy, Leaving the World.</p>


            <p>“We all talk about how much we hate lies. Yet we prefer, so often, to be lied to....because it allows us
                to dodge all those painful truths we'd rather not hear.”
                ― Douglas Kennedy, Leaving the World</p>


            <p>“We all want to fix things. Just as we all believe that so much in life can be rectified. Mend fences,
                build bridges, reach out, engage in mutual healing.”
                ― Douglas Kennedy, Leaving the World </p>


            <p> “But the strangest of all sensations is the moment after you have been freed of the baby--and the baby
                of you--and
                you are handed this tiny shriveled creature to hold for the first time... and you feel a mixture of
                unbelievable instant love and desperate fear.”
                ― Douglas Kennedy, Leaving the World</p>

            <p>“There were moments when I felt seriously unhinged; when I was convinced that I would never, ever recover
                from what had happened,
                when it was absolutely clear to me that life from this point on would be constant agony ...”
                ― Douglas Kennedy, Leaving the World</p>

            <p>A lot of coding best practices emphasize keeping code lean and well organized.</p>
